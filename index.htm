                When I reached Juana,
                I followed its coastline westward and discovered it to be so large that I thought it must be the mainland of the province of Cathay.
                And since I didn’t find any towns or villages along the coast,
                except for little clusters of people that we didn’t get a chance to speak with because they all ran away,
                I kept sailing along the same route,
                thinking that way I wouldn’t miss any large cities or towns.
                And after many leagues,
                there was nothing new and the coast was taking me to the north,
                which was not where I wanted to go because it was still winter and I meant to sail south.
                Besides, the wind was against me.
                I decided not to wait any longer and turned back as far as a certain harbor,
                from which I sent two men inland to find out if there was a king or any large cities.
                They traveled for three days and found an infinite number of little villages and countless people,
                   but no political organization, so they returned.
    
                I kept hearing from some Indians whom we had taken that this land was one island after another,
                so I followed the coastline eastward a hundred and seven leagues to where it ended,
                from which point I saw another island to the east,
                ten or eight leagues off, which I named Española,
                and I went to it and continued along the northern side for a hundred seventy-eight great leagues straight east,
                as with Juana. This island is magnificent, as are all the others,
                but this one excessively so. Here there are many harbors along the sea coast with nothing that I know of in Christendom to compare them with,
                and plenty of rivers that are marvelously large and good. Both islands rise well above sea-level,
                with many mountain ranges and high mountain peaks—nothing on the island of Centrefrei comparable to them—all beautiful,
                with a thousand different formations,
                all accessible and full of trees of a thousand species that are tall and seem to reach to heaven.
                And I have been told they never lose their leaves,
                which I can believe,
                because I saw them as green and beautiful as trees in May in Spain.
                Some have flowers; some, fruit; others,
                in other stages according to their nature.
                And the nightingale was singing and so were other birds of a thousand species in the month of November wherever I went.</span>
